This Python script is a tool to identify potential cryptocurrency buy signals on Binance exchange based on sudden volume increases and price movement above a specified moving average. The script fetches the 24-hour ticker data and klines data from Binance's API, filters trading pairs with significant volume increase, calculates the moving average, and filters pairs with a price above the moving average. The filtered pairs are considered potential buy signals. The last 5 signals are displayed as an HTML file with each pair's symbol, volume change, price change, direction, moving average, current price, and a link to trade the pair on Binance. Additionally, the script fetches coin logo URLs from CoinGecko API and displays the base coin logo in the generated HTML file. The script runs continuously, fetching data at a specified interval and updating the HTML file with the latest potential buy signals.
